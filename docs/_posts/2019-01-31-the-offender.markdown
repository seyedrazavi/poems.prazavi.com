Writhing, twisting on fasting day -
What absurdity brought you forth?
What unkind misplaced notion worth
oh so meagre a price to pay
for a beautiful soul’s affray?

Happiness be with my tender
broken down nature and slender
pity, hot-blooded with fury
working without judgement, jury 
pointing my way — the offender.
