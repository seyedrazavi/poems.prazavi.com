A voyage must begin within the heart
if distant prizes worth our time be found.
Overcome the challenge, spirit can prevail.

Unloading cargo, heaving over the sea, 
the captain’s price for travel never free.
A voyage must begin within the heart.

O’shining light of morning rays allow
the shroud of proud achievement fade away
if distant prizes worth our time be found.

In trusting life to fate, content we are
however plans unroll at journey’s end.
Overcome the challenge, spirit can prevail.
