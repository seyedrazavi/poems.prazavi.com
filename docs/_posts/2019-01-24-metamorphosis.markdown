In transformation, the first and most important task is self-nourishment. Only then can the work of outgrowing the larval skin begin. Molting away the past exposes the tenderness of the present. This process of growth and molting repeats and repeats. Only once the conventional form has reached its maximal potential, can the process of metamorphosis truly begin. Thus, the chrysalis is the culmination of a process of change, as well as the beginning of the beginning of true being.

Red, violet beauty
Paper thin lustrous wide span
Self-portrait, my heart
