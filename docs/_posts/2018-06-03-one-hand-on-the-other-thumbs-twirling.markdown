The day you were yanked out of your
mother, gray and cold, just about
breathing - I knew I loved you.
My life’s pleasures aplenty,
but joys - just two until
you. Fingers snap
around mine
gripping
testudine
I put
on your cap
then your mother’s
first embrace. Warmed
by lamplight, soft shell soul
a weighty trust enthroned
on my chest and throat. Tears, gasping -
the day gleams still true, ma petite tortue.
