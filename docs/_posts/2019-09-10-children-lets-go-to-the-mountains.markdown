Children, let's go to the mountains.
There is nothing left for us here.
The land has gone the way of songs
leaving nothing but silence & aches.

Children, let's run to the forests.
The cities are lost to us now.
Now waters risen, dead bury
the living in towers of plastic & waste.

Children, let's hide in the desert.
Lost caravans due to arrive;
the gates are shut by artful swine,
their snouts buried deep in excess & strife.

Children, let's rest under a blanket 
of far travelling light. Mothers
wherever you tend, care will bring 
renewal. Love: the elixir of life.
