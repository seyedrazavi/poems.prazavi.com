in your eyes, I am lost in time
as young as we were when we met
for the first time, bodies embraced
in search of who we thought we were.

talking over dinner, my dreams 
in your eyes, I am lost in time
building the future we both seek
out of whole cloth, so it would seem.

around us a madrigal in
harmony bolsters the bright gleam
in your eyes, I am lost in time
of rhythmic heartbeat, yours and mine.

our nursery days behind us,
we rest our feet, earned contentment 
savour the memories I see
in your eyes, I am lost in time.
