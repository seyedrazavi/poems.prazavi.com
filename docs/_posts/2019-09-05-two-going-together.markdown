In poverty, suppose our last resort should depend
not on luck or handouts but on the love of a friend

In youth, save us from unrecoverable error,
guided through treacherous weather with help from a friend

In old age, with a caring heart lean on the other,
diminished strength overcome on the back of a friend

In our prime, performing noble deeds, act together.
Two hearts and two minds are better, life shared with a friend

Walking in the stormy season, I need some wisdom.
I search for meaning: Love is lifeâ€™s refrain, my dear friend
