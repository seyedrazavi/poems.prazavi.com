Every day I learn with you
 what it is you really need.
It's ok to cry -
 not a taciturn army-drilled pilgrim

(sometimes a prickly cactus).
Strong is able to say sorry;
be gentle my son:
 protecting, not controlling, those you love.

Smart is saying I don't know, 
 no shame in being curious. 
Heart learning to seek 
compassion always starts with sharing joy.
 
We beam when we see you grow.
It is ok to be afraid -
 only way courage 
 grows. Sometimes, I want to wrap you up so, 
 
but oh how tall you'll be, go
 become the man we hope, we know
 you will be, one day 
 (no rush, take your time, more for us to know).
