Mother Rachel come
weep for your children.
Drowning in their own fluids.
Sing a lullaby
of hope once promised.
Marching time is circling back
to the first question:
_Who is my brother?_
Peel away their bruised black skin.
Peel away the state.
Peel away the lies.
Pull down their golden idols.
Whip cracked, pressed down.
Hypoxia silent.
Lips pressed on childâ€™s lips
Weep for your children,
Mother Rachel _breathe_.
