In a dream I had when I was seven,
you stood tall and lean, looming over me,
praising something, I donâ€™t remember what.
All of my sisters lined up to listen.
Of the six, only one of them was born
but in my dream, all were there, listening,
dark glistening hair woven into one.

Daughters of the moon and stars.
