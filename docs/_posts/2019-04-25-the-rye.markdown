Gusty swaying tree
white feathers draping branches
abandoned nestlings

River narrowing
browns lacklustre in winter
isolated stream

Pungent mulch odor
composting for Spring flowers
overcomes decay

Dogs unleashed, roaming
each walker with five or six
squirrels nowhere seen

Winter walking bounds of Rye
magpie saluting goodbye
