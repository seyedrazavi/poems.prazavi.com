You were the miracle that woke up
the doctors given up.
Skull fractured into seven, dead for
fifteen minutes, endured,
how your mother must’ve prayed for you.
_I hit the concrete hard, then
the trailer hit me._ Now smiling,
Alabama mama:
_It was God, nothing else explains…_

You were shot dead, mom and dad broken.
_a London crime victim._
Shotgun pellets cratered your sweet head.
_Callous, reckless, brazen._
Is that all that the police had said?
As blood pooled, mama cried
_Let my son be the last_, she prayed,
_So much potential wasted,
Lord, please just let it be ended._

You are a future world champion.
A top class coach in tow,
Nigeria’s role model and hope.
How your papa prayed you
would play tennis from the age of four.
Your friends all wondering,
_What is this funny sport?_ Your spirit
fighting, resolve to play.

You were just thirteen years old in May.
