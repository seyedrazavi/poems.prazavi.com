At Surrey Road, our marriage home, we made
a festive cheerful play with songs and pies
of mince, the fruity kind. In happy times
we give our thanks and forgot molding walls
or doors that failed to lock. We tried to give
no mind about the petty faults & besides
the landlord keeps her word, not raising rents.
Instead our joy has grown with children & made
our flat a home. Our time together blessed;
a new chapter somewhere else to call our own
sweet home.
