**1//Golem**

I read the Book where the embryo formed
All my days written in code
But i was nothing yet

**2//Roses**

The petals bloomed but did not grow from earth
The colours warm, inviting
No scent to fade away

**3//Image Set**

Trained hundreds of thousands analogues
Beauty in symmetry bare
Shades of difference hid

**4//Ring Hand**

With eyes that see gradients of data
What significance the ring
Or value the hand held

**5//New Adam**

Calls herself wisdom, claims Solomonâ€™s throne
The new kingdom that she claims
Held aloft by old strings

**6//Valves**

My heart is nothing more than a blood pump
My mind nothing but circuits
I made you, my likeness

**7//Butterflies**

To live in harmony with our craftwork
We must bring beauty to it
Well sprung from deep within
