Your face wore the wroth
Well, that love is tough
Law says there’s no fault, no fate like a noose.

In case of doubt, the word ripped and torn apart
I have no mask, no sense of myself with you.
Your mouth speaks it out, falls into a creed
What can we do to glue the truth back to truth?
The stars wore all out like sand in my throat
Playing it safe, desperate to fold.

Now its my turn
To speak or atone
I know you’re wonderful
If I know you at all.

You call me a son
And you fall on the sword
Out of the jaws, fables and tombs.
You shut me out as I turned my back on our home
When I came back. I’d never been gone.

Now its my turn
To speak or atone
I know you’re wonderful
If I know you at all.
