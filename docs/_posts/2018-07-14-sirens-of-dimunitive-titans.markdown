A shoe, a shoe!
My limbs trapped in a space no bigger
than the distance my heart can pump 
blood, clattering and ceaseless chewing,
spoon on dish twisting, blood vessels
cramped in quarters and drawn,
pulsing over coals.

Somebody open the window and help us
climb out, a ladder waiting.
Waiting and there in the Vonnegut recount,
candid disassembling, fever
pitch my light-foil kite sails,
thundering winds hoist us upwards free,
an escape, an escape!
