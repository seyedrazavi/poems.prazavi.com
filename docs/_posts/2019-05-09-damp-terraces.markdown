The day Mischa Brown did show
his face around here once more
his mam did swear
she would give the killing blow

The sight of his pa on his regal throne
reading the paper as ash dropped
on the bathroom floor
her blue tirade did rattle the bones

His gram knew what was what
skiving school, smoking grass
making himself a nuisance
she was having none of that

Off to uni, had a spat with the lass
gave his friends all of that
too good for her, ey posh lad
she bet heâ€™d come crawling back
