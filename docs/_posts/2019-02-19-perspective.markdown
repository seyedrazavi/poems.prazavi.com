@ the speed of galaxies colliding,
@ the turn of neutrons,
bending through a gravity well:
I, cells and tissue;
I, acidic code stretching light years;
I, a history and agent within / for
society / culture / family!
Thou, ego and id;
Thou, growth and reproduction;
Thou, memory and expectations;
Us, a frame of reference
fixed / loose / fuzzy /
fluid.
All that concern for freedom, yet
what remains
when we pay attention
is love. Only
love.
