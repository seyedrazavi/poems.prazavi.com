**I.**

Do we lie here? Our plots completed? Are we still remembered?
Our thoughts are with you, eyes distant and vacant as they murmured.

Plodding through trodden mud, chasing a wet dog smell, unwashed hair
Fetching some reserve of stamina, a contentment murmured.

A chesty cough, a raucous snore, a fevered glow beckons
Syringe of suspended medicine and peaceful dreams murmured.

Chortles and smiles, pursed lips, crisp kisses blown and red puffed cheeks proud
To be a delight, a temper set to fury, she murmured.

Exploring glass and steel landscape, falcons in pigeon trenches
Razavi's blinking icons, fast text rolling, my heart murmured.

To

benefit

of removal, I

must still exist — Schopenhauer

A clay jar

pulsing fire

from a star

smashed to earth,

shattered tender hearts.

Gravel beneath the fresh morning sun
Tires spinning as we puff, pant and run
To catch the urban tide before it hides
A race to the bottom can’t be won
