title: Buck up your ideas, kiddo

Up I go, up the cliff face
leaping and bleating
horns locked with yours
my caprine heart blind
tongue needling tuft to justify.
Up I leap, up my face turns
feasting and gluttonous
mind, tramel your reasoning
with a litany of reversals
despite the pleading
to be heard.

And you cry.

Now youâ€™ve got me
raging until the spirit rests
begrudging what is needful
no less than this for my baleful
eye to open and see
you. As you are.
Not a moon in orbit of my mountain
not a shrub, nor grain, nor hay to occasion
when the steep gives no more fleeting.
Up I get, up from my hircine perch
my spirit for yours leaping.
