Hallowed, beat 
by beat, you meet
a brass band with a royal horn.
Dancing, keep on -
the big debt cannot wait,
your body taut, twisting fate -
sacrifice turns ill-fated peace
into promises ill-suited to keep.
Nova refracted
through the cavern’s walls, soma
drips like sweat condensing,
an elephant’s heart marches, tensing
in your chest, thwarting sleep.
An empty waiting, weep
in your trembling, relief
sightless, guileless
stumbling, then… just then,
barometer thick with mist….
the beat, the beat, 
the beat.
